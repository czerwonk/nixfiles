# nixfiles

## Disclaimer
These are the system and home-manager configurations of my systems. This setup defined by the ``flake.nix`` file also requires nix modules from a private repository. 
Thus said, these configs and modules are more for inspiration than for running out of the box for anyone other than myself.
