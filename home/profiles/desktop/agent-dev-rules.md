# Development Rules

1. **Task Management**
  - Break into small, completable units
  - Track in `docs/todo.md`:
    - [ ] Current/upcoming tasks
    - [x] Completed tasks
    - Development decisions + rationale
    - Recurring issues + solutions
    - Technical debt
    - Code audit reminders

2. **Git Discipline**
  - Commit after each file-modifying task
  - Format: `type: description` (feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore)

3. **Scope Control**
  - Only implement explicit requests
  - Clarify ambiguities
  - Log additional ideas as separate tasks

## Workflow
1. Pick task → Complete → Update todo.md → Commit
